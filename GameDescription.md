Strategy Forge is a real-time strategy game where players must manage their resources, build and upgrade their base, and fend off waves of enemy units. The game features a variety of unit types, each with unique abilities and strengths, as well as a tech tree to unlock new units and upgrades. The game also features a dynamic economy system, where players must gather resources to build and upgrade their base, and a combat system where players must fend off waves of enemy units. The game is designed to be challenging and engaging, with a focus on strategy and resource management.

The unique aspects of the game are in the base is really a slow moving mechanical base that must get to a specific location on the map. Instead of building ancilary building to support the base, the building will attach or move along with the base. Some buildings will be defensive, others will help move the base faster.  Others will help with resource gathering and unit production.  The other teams are trying to also get to the same location and hold the position.  If you get there too fast you may not be able to hold the potions because we will not have a lot of resources to build a strong base.  The game is about gathering resources, building a strong base, and holding the position.
